# Parking Space Detection and Counting

This project uses **Computer Vision** and **AI** techniques to detect and count parking spaces from video footage. The system identifies the available and occupied parking spots in real-time using image processing methods and deep learning.

## Overview
The Parking Space Detection and Counting system is designed to assist in monitoring parking lots by providing an automatic way to detect available and occupied parking spaces. This system uses a combination of techniques such as:
- Video Processing
- Object Detection
- Image Segmentation
- Deep Learning Models

The primary objective of this project is to analyze parking space occupancy through video footage and classify the parking spots as **available** or **occupied**.

## Features
- **Parking Spot Detection**: Identifies individual parking spots in a given parking lot.
- **Real-Time Counting**: Counts the number of available and occupied parking spots in real-time.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures the accuracy, precision, and recall of the detection model.
- **Resource Usage Monitoring**: Monitors CPU and memory usage during the execution of the program.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For image and video processing.
- **Scikit-Image**: For image segmentation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning model (if used for further implementation).
- **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**: To handle large files in the repository (e.g., videos and models).
